# There are two main ways to get clients list from. First is local list there,
# in Ansible variables. Second is LDAP.
#
# So, first go to the local clients list options.
#
# List of clients to issue certificate for. In case this list will be less
# than server active clients, non-existing in this list will be revoked.
# List of users consists of none or more hashes with appropriate values. Next
# values are supported:
# - name: Is the name of client. Required
# - email: Client email. If exists, created .ovpn file will be sent to it.
#          Optional
# - ip_info: IP address and subnet mask of client. If exists, will be set to
#            client CCD ifconfig-push. Optional
# Example of clients list:
# clients:
#   - name: user
#     email: user@example.com
#     ip_info: "192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0"
# Default clients list is empty.
